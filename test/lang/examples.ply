  // Example of a common dependent type:
  // 'c' captures a byte that represents the length of a vector of
  // bytes, captured by 'v'.  The conversion of 'c' into the integer length
  // value is done by the library function $int_of_byte().
  DepVec dv { val: [u8] } :=
    c=([:byte:]) v=([[:byte:]*$int_of_byte(c)])
    { dv.val := v }

  // The current syntax only supports such constructions for data
  // captured by character classes; but does not yet support it for
  // general non-terminals.
