(** This module provides a simple pretty-printer for the terms
    maintained by a unifier.

    We follow the convention that types and type schemes are represented
    using the same data structure. In the case of type schemes, universally
    quantified type variables are distinguished by the fact that their rank
    is [none]. The pretty-printer binds these variables locally, while other
    (non-quantified) type variables are considered part of a global namespace.
