= Lesson 1: The User Datagram Protocol

For our first exercise, we examine the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)].
The UDP specification is provided in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768[IETF RFC 768].
UDP is a transport layer protocol used alongside IP.
In contrast to TCP, another transport layer protocol, UDP does not provide some useful guarantees, such as reliability and in-order messaging.
However, it is lightweight and simple, making it a great introductory example use case for this Parsley tutorial.

== Declarations

A format specification in Parsley is constructed via a sequence of <<../intro.adoc#structure-of-a-parsley-specification-file, declarations>>.
Parsley currently supports the following classes of declarations:

* `include` declarations that enable the  inclusion of declarations from other files within the same Parsley specification.
* `import` declarations that enable the import of declarations from files from other Parsley specifications.
* `const` definitions to support .,constant expressions.
* `type` definitions that allow users to specify their own types.
* `fun` and `recfun` declarations that correspond to functions and recursive functions respectively.
* `format` block declarations that specify non-terminal definitions.

In this first lesson, we will use the `format` and `type` declarations.

== A (Very) Brief Introduction to Parsley Types

The specification states that the UDP header comprises four fields corresponding to the source port, destination port, length, and checksum.
Each is of two bytes.
In our specification, the source port, destination port, and length fields are treated as 16-bit unsigned integers, and the checksum is treated as a list of bytes.
That said, there exist valid alternatives to this approach, e.g., the source port and destination port could also be byte lists.
Following the UDP header is the payload or data.
Given this structure, we can declare a `type` to capture a UDP packet:

....
type udp_packet = {
  source_port: u16,
  destination_port: u16,
  length: u16,
  checksum: [byte],
  data: [byte]
}
....

We provide a quick primer on types here but a more comprehensive treatment can be found in the <<../expressions.adoc#types, documentation>>.

NOTE: As an aside, the observant reader may have noticed that the `udp_packet` type declaration does not enforce the requirement that the `checksum` field be exactly two bytes long.
However, the `udp_packet` is merely a user-defined type.
The enforcement of the length requirement will be done when we specify the grammar in the the `format` block.
Don't fret!
We will get to this soon.


=== Atomic Types

Parsley supports a variety of atomic or built-in types:

* `byte`: captures a byte
* `u8` , `u16`, `u32`, `u65`; `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`; `usize`; `isize`: are used to capture various kinds of integers.
** `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, and `u64` correspond to unsigned integers of bit lengths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 respectively.
** `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, and `i64` correspond to signed integers of bit lengths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 respectively.
** `usize` corresponds to an unsized integer of unspecified length.
** `isize` corresponds to a signed integer of unspecified length.
* `double`: captures a floating-point
* `string`: captures a sequence of characters
* `bool`: captures a Boolean or truth value
* `endian`: captures endian values that express what byte ordering to use when interpreting integer values
* `unit`: a type to express that a function returns nothing (similar to void in C)

=== User-Defined Types

Parsley also supports user-defined types. We can construct these user-defined types via type declarations of the form:

....
type type_name = type_form
....

where `type_name` and `type_form` correspond to the identifier for the type and the structure or form of the type.

Some examples of user-defined type declarations are:

- `type byte_list = [byte]` is a list of bytes.
- `type int_bool_tuple = (u16, bool)` is a tuple with element types `u16` and `bool` respectively
- `type list_of_tuples = [(u32, u32)]` is a list of two-tuples with element types `u32` and `u32`.

A special kind of user-defined type is the record type.
The record type comprises a number of component type fields and has the general form of:

....
type type_name = {
  field_name_0: field_type_0,
  field_name_1: field_type_1,
  ...
  field_name_n: field_type_n
}
....

Each line within the curly brackets specifies a component field via a field name and type.
Each field declaration, aside from the last one, is terminated by a `,` delimiter.

NOTE: There is much more to discuss about types, notably variant types and type variables. The Parsley <<../expressions.adoc#types, documentation on types>> discusses these topics further.

=== Declaring the UDP Packet Type

Let's return to our UDP packet.

....
type udp_packet = {
  source_port: u16,
  destination_port: u16,
  length: u16,
  checksum: [byte],
  data: [byte]
}
....

The `udp_packet` is a record type that comprises five component subtypes or fields.

The first four fields correspond to the UDP header: `source_port` is a 16-bit unsigned integer, `destination_port` is a 16-bit unsigned integer, `length` is a 16-bit  unsigned integer, and `checksum` is a list of bytes.
The last component field, `data, captures the the payload, and it is also a list of bytes.
Now that we have captured the general structure of a UDP packet, we can move on to capturing the specification in Parsley.

== The Format Block

The `format` block is essential to _every_ Parsley specification.
This is where we define non-terminals and, as the name suggests, specify the format of the specification.
The `format` block has the general form:

....
format {
  NT1 n1 ... := ...;;
  NT2 n2 ... := ...;;
  ...
}
....

The `format` block is simply a sequence of non-terminal definitions.
Each definition, except for the last, must end with `;;`, which serves as a non-terminal definition delimiter.

=== Non-Terminals, Synthesized Attributes, and Inherited Attributes

Parsley provides a rich subgrammar that has some similarity with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_form[BNF] but also a number of key differences.
Here, we will only cover the basics; more topics will be introduced in subsequent lessons.
A <<../grammar.adoc#defining-non-terminals, non-terminal>> is derived using one or more production rules that are separated by `;`, the ordered choice operator.
Each production rule is a sequence of rule elements.
A sequence of rule elements is matched if the input matches each of the rule elements in order.

In this first lesson, we cover the standard approach to defining non-terminals.
A non-terminal in Parsley has a type associated with it, which is always the record type using the standard approach.
This type is specified by synthesized attributes, which can be thought of as attributes that are derived as we perform the matching.
Additionally, a type declaration may include inherited attributes, which are attributes that are provided when the non-terminal is used in a rule element or invoked by a call from external application code.


NOTE: Parsley also supports an alternative approach for defining byte-vector--valued non-terminals, one which uses regular expressions. We shall cover this in a future lesson!

=== Working Through the UDP Packet Format

Now, let's work on developing a Parsley specification for a UDP packet:

....
format {
  UDPPacket udpp {u: udp_packet} := ...
}
....

We still have to fill in the details obviously, but this is a good start.
We have a non-terminal entitled `UDPPacket` that has the short name of `udpp`.
And it has the synthesized attribute `u` of type `udp_packet`, which we had defined earlier; synthesized attributes like these are specified within curly brackets.

NOTE: While the original specification does not explicitly require using the big-endian byte order,
the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1700[Assigned Numbers RFC] specifies that Internet Protocols should be expressed in network byte order, i.e., big-endian byte order.
Hence, we follow this approach. However, If we had instead wished to pass in an endian value as an inherited attribute to UDPPacket, we would have written: `UDPPacket udpp (e: endian) {u: udp_packet} := ...`.

Now, let's work on the rule elements.
The UDP specification states the header comprises four fields, each of two bytes, corresponding to the source port, the destination port, the length, and the checksum.
Thus, we have four identifiers (`source_port`, `destination_port`, `length`, `checksum`) to capture these header fields.
And, of course, we have `data` whose length is derived from the value matched by the `length` identifier.

....
format {
  UDPPacket udpp {u: udp_packet} :=
    source_port = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    destination_port = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    length = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    checksum = (Byte^2u) 
    [length >=_u16 8u16]
    data = (Byte^(Usize.of_u16(length) -_u 8u))
}
....

`UInt16 (endian: endian)` and `Byte` are built-in non-terminals that match a 16-bit unsigned integer and a byte respectively.
The identifiers `source_port`, `destination_port`, and `length` are assigned 16-bit unsigned integer values of the endianness `endian::Big()`.
The identifier `checksum` is matched to a list of two bytes by applying the bounded repeat operator (`^`) to the `Byte` built-in non-terminal using the operand `2u` (a literal of type `usize` with value 2).
A 16-bit unsigned integer of the endianness `endian::Big()` is assigned to the length identifier.

NOTE: The <<../stdlib.adoc#, Parsley Library Standard Documentation>> provides an in-depth discussion of built-in variant types, built-in non-terminals, and module operations.

NOTE: Parsley supports the construction of various kinds of literals corresponding to different types, e.g., `4u8` is an 8-bit unsigned integer corresponding to the value 4, `7i64` is a 64-bit signed integer corresponding to the value 7, `endian::Small()` is an endian value of small, `"hello"` is the string reading __hello__. As we come across literals in this tutorial, we will briefly remark on them; a more thorough treatment can be found in the <<../expressions.adoc#expressions, documentation on expressions>>.

Our next task is to read in the data, but this requires first ensuring the length value is reasonable.
We do this by imposing a constraint.

==== Constraints

A constraint is simply a parsing check.
More precisely, a constraint captures a Boolean-valued expression that determines whether or not to continue with the current production rule.
If the expression evaluates to a false Boolean value, then the constraint is not met and the production rule does not apply.
If, however, the constraint evaluates to a true Boolean value, then the constraint is met and we move on to the next rule element in the production rule.

In our UDP example, the constraint `[length >=_u16 8u16]` does a check to ensure the `length` variable is assigned a value of at least 8.
More precisely, it uses the built-in greater-than-or-equal-to operator for 16-bit unsigned integers to ensure that the identifier `length` matches a `u16` value that is at least `8u16`.
If it were assigned a value less than `8u16`, then we would immediately determine that the packet is malformed since the header itself is 8 bytes.

==== Reading the Payload

Next, we must read in the bytes corresponding to `data`.
The exact amount of bytes to read can be obtained by some simple arithmetic using the previously matched `length` identifier.
Indeed, the pattern of reading in some length value and then later reading in a payload based on that value is extremely common when dealing with specifications.

In our case, the `length` identifier we had matched earlier corresponds to the full UDP packet length; ergo, the payload length is obtained by subtracting 8 from it.
We apply the bounded repeat operator (`^`) to `Byte`, in similar fashion as we had done when reading in the checksum.
However, as the operand to the bounded repeat operator (`^`) must be of type `usize`, we must first use the standard library function `Usize.of_u16()` to create a value that is of the same length as `length` but of type `usize`.
We then subtract `8u` (value 8 of type `usize`) from the resultant value by using the subtraction operator for operands of type `usize` (`-_u`).
Thus, we get: `data = (Byte^(Usize.of_u16(length) -_u 8u))`.

==== Action Blocks

All that is left is to assign values to the synthesized variables.
We do this via action blocks:

....
format {
  UDPPacket udpp {u: udp_packet} :=
    ...
    {
      udpp.u.source_port := source_port;
      udpp.u.destination_port := destination_port;
      udpp.u.length := length;
      udpp.u.checksum := checksum;
      udpp.u.data := data
    }
}
....


The assignment of values to the synthesized attributes is performed by the action block, which is delimited by `{` and `}`.
The `:=`  symbol in action blocks denote assignment.
Each assignment statement in an action block aside from the last must end with the `;` delimiter.
There are other uses for action blocks as well, and we will cover them in future lessons.

In our UDP example, `udpp` is the short name for the non-terminal we are working on.
`udpp.u` refers to the `udp_packet` record attached to the `udpp` non-terminal.
In a straightforward fashion, we are simply assigning the fields in the `udpp.u` record the values of the variables that we have obtained by reading the input earlier.

==== The Final Parsley File

Thus, we have our final Parsley file (`udp.ply`):

....
type udp_packet = {
  source_port: u16,
  destination_port: u16,
  length: u16,
  checksum: [byte],
  data: [byte]
}

format {
  UDPPacket udpp {u: udp_packet} :=
    source_port = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    destination_port = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    length = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    checksum = (Byte^2u) 
    [length >=_u16 8u16] // length field must be at least 8, the UDP header length
    data = (Byte^(Usize.of_u16(length) -_u 8u)) // subtract 8 for the UDP header length
    //[validate_checksum(source_port, destination_port, length, checksum, data)]
    {
      udpp.u.source_port := source_port;
      udpp.u.destination_port := destination_port;
      udpp.u.length := length;
      udpp.u.checksum := checksum;
      udpp.u.data := data
    }
}
....

==== Comments

You may noticed that we have incorporated some comments in our final Parsley file.
Comments in Parsley begin with two forward slash characters (`//`).
Everything between the `//` delimiter and the first new line character to follow it is part of the comment.

==== Do We Need a `udp_packet` Type?

We had earlier declared a `udp_packet` type, which is used as a synthesized attribute in the UDPPacket non-terminal declaration.
Of course, we did not _have to_ define such a type.
Indeed, we could have instead supplied synthesized attributes corresponding to the type's member fields.
We have provided such an implementation in `udp_alt.ply`, and we have pasted the Parsley file's contents below.

....
format {
  UDPPacket udpp {source_port: u16, destination_port: u16, length: usize,
                  checksum: [byte], data: [byte]} :=
    source_port = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    destination_port = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    length = UInt16<endian=endian::Big()>
    checksum = (Byte^2u)
    [length >=_u16 8u16] // length field must be at least 8, the UDP header length
    data = (Byte^(Usize.of_u16(length) -_u 8u)) // subtract 8 for the UDP header length
    {
      udpp.source_port := source_port;
      udpp.destination_port := destination_port;
      udpp.length := Usize.of_u16(length);
      udpp.checksum := checksum;
      udpp.data := data
    }
}
....

That said, there are numerous benefits to declaring and using a record type, e.g., modularization, code brevity, readability, and consequently improved security.
These benefits are especially pronounced in larger projects that make heavy use of the user-defined type.
In the next lesson, we will demonstrate how to use the `udp_packet` type when implementing a subset of IPv4.

==== Exercise: The Simple Message Specification

As a simple exercise, consulting the <<../expressions.adoc#expressions, Parsley documentation on expressions>>, try to write a Parsley specification for the following mock message format:

A __simple message__ contains four parts, ordered as follows: (1) the 5-byte string __"hello"__, (2) a `length` value that specifies, the byte-length of a short message as an 8-bit unsigned integer, (3) a `message` that is a list of bytes of length `length`, (4) the 7-byte string __"goodbye"__. 

For the Parsley specification, store `length` and `message` in a record type as a synthesized attribute. An example Parsley specification for __simple message__ is provided in simple_message.ply.

NOTE: There is an even easier way to implement this specification in Parsley using <<../grammar.adoc#rules-and-rule-elements, regular expressions>>, which we will cover in a couple of lessons.
