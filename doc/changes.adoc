Version 0.2.0 (in-progress)
---------------------------

- A module system for composing specifications.

- An experimental external or 'foreign' function interface for the
  interpreter that enables calls into OCaml code from Parsley.

- The keyword `include` replaced `use` and has the same file-inclusion
  semantics.

- `.` was removed as an indicator for the wildcard in regular
  expressions; `#` remains now as the only symbol for a wildcard.

- Replacement of the `int` type with a numeric tower, comprising the
  `{iu}{8,16,32,64,size}` types, their type-specific arithmetic and
  bit-manipulation operators, and conversions between them.

- Addition of a `$print_t` primitive to print textual or string-valued
  data.

- Additions to the `Bits` module of the standard library to account
  for endianness when converting bitvectors to integers.
