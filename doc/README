The general idea is that Parsley supports modular specifications.  As
an example, the outermost layer of the PDF syntax is sketched out in
three modules:

* pdfprim - primitive PDF objects that do not contain other PDF objects

* pdfobj - more complex PDF objects

* pdfdoc - the overall PDF document layout

These files are not intended to be entirely accurate in all details
with respect to the PDF specification, but are only to illustrate the
general syntax of the Parsley language, and how it could capture the
essential features needed for a more accurate PDF specification.

This is still a very early sketch of the Parsley language, which will
likely evolve significantly from the sketch presented here.
